# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

## Future Work
The project suggests separating hour from datetime to have additional feature, but others may include:
- Feature that categorizes morning, lunch, and evening rush hour, 7-9am, 11am-1pm, and 5-6pm.
- Feature that categorizes hot/cold/mild temps from temp.
- Feature that categories very windy/mild wind.
- Feature that categories very humid/ not humid.
- Perform multiple rounds of hyperparameter tuning to see if it improves Kaggle score!

- Test individual algorithm types (KNN, Neural Nets, RF, XGBoost, etc) and write a detailed analysis of which one performs better on this dataset.
